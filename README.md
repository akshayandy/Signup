## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Signup Web Page, built using Spring Tool Suite (STS). The web page allows users to register for our service by entering their personal information, which is then stored in a database. Additionally, it offer a sign-in feature, which allows registered users to access their accounts by entering their credentials, which are then compared with the information stored in the database. To use the Signup Web Page, simply navigate to the registration page and enter user personal information, including your name, email address, and password. Once submitted, user information will be stored in the database, and user will be redirected to the sign-in page. On the sign-in page, enter your email address and password to access your account. It took almost 10 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the wire-frames for all relevant feature pages.
